### Installing

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
    ```sh
    https://github.com/alexandrac1420/RealTimeInteractiveBoardRedis
    cd BoardWebSocketRedis1
    ```

2. Build the Spring Boot backend:
    ```sh
    mvn package
    ```

    Should display output similar to:
    ```sh
    [INFO] Building jar: C:\Users\alexandra.cortes\Downloads\BoardWebSocket\target\BoardWebSocket-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar       
    [INFO] The original artifact has been renamed to C:\Users\alexandra.cortes\Downloads\BoardWebSocket\target\BoardWebSocket-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the backend and frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Redis is running** (if not already running):
    ```sh
    docker start some-redis
    ```

2. **Run the Spring Boot backend:**
    ```sh
    cd demo
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    The backend will start on `https://localhost:8443`, and it will store the drawing board's data (i.e., the points that are drawn) and session information in Redis.

## Architectural Design

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d8271b-ee93-4747-a725-32ac669c1f4d)


### BBCanvas Component (React)

The BBCanvas component uses P5.js to manage interactions on the canvas and WebSocket communication:

**Features:**
- Uses P5.js to draw and handle interactions on the HTML5 canvas.
- Manages WebSocket connection (comunicationWS) to send and receive real-time data from the server.
- Renders points on the canvas based on coordinates received from the server, allowing real-time updates.

### Editor Component (React)

The Editor component provides the main structure of the application and contains the BBCanvas:

**Features:**
- Defines the user interface structure, integrating the BBCanvas component for direct interaction with the interactive board.

### WSBBChannel Class (JavaScript)

The WSBBChannel class facilitates WebSocket communication between the client and server:

**Features:**
- Manages WebSocket connection with the Spring Boot server.
- Sends JSON messages representing coordinates of points drawn by the client to the server and distributes these updates to all connected clients.

### BBAppStarter (@SpringBootApplication)

BBAppStarter is the entry point of the Spring Boot application:

**Features:**
- Configures and starts the Spring Boot application, defining server settings such as the execution port.
- Handles incoming requests from the client through REST controllers and WebSocket endpoints.

### BBConfigurator (@Configuration)

BBConfigurator provides configuration to the Spring application context:

**Features:**
- Configures the export of the WebSocket endpoint (/bbService), allowing WebSocket connections between the client and server.

### BBEndpoint (@ServerEndpoint)

BBEndpoint acts as a server endpoint for WebSocket connections:

**Features:**
- Manages bidirectional communication between the client and server via WebSocket.
- Receives and distributes JSON messages (coordinates of drawn points) among all connected clients to maintain synchronization on the interactive board.

### DrawingServiceController (@RestController)

DrawingServiceController is a REST controller handling incoming HTTP requests:

**Features:**
- Provides REST endpoints for the client to obtain information about the server's status and other operations unrelated to drawing on the interactive board.

### Redis and Ticket-Based Authorization

The application uses Redis for session management and ticket-based authorization to enhance security and performance:

**Features:**
- Stores session data in Redis to manage user sessions efficiently.
- Utilizes ticket-based authorization for secure WebSocket connections, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the drawing board.

## Deployment on AWS

Follow these steps to deploy the application on AWS:

1. **Start the virtual machine**

    Launch an EC2 instance with your preferred configuration.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/alexandrac1420/CalculadoraWeb/blob/master/Pictures/image.png)

2. **Transfer dependencies and the JAR file**

    Upload the dependencies.zip (containing necessary dependencies) and the built JAR file to the created virtual machine.
    ![alt text](https://github.com/alexandrac1420/CalculadoraWeb/blob/master/Pictures/image-1.png)
    ![alt text](https://github.com/alexandrac1420/CalculadoraWeb/blob/master/Pictures/image-2.png)

3. **Execute the following command**

    Navigate to the directory where you uploaded the files and run:
    ```sh
     java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    This will start the Spring service.

4. Start the Spring service

    Ensure the Spring Boot application starts without errors.

5. Verify the deployment

    Check the application's availability using the public DNS of the EC2 instance on port 8443, e.g.,
